Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project for Coursera Project
This post was made in term of last project in Getting and Cleanung Data Course Project in coursera. After we download the data and put in working directory, and unzip downloaded file. The run_analysis.R will do following task:

1. Set the working directory, read the downloaded data and convert it into data frame
2. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
3. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
4. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
5. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
6. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. Final data will saved in "data_tidy_final.txt"
